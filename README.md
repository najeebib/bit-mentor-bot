## Overview
The Bit Mentor Bot is a Telegram bot designed to interact with users by asking questions and providing answers in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. It communicates with a backend server to fetch questions and submit answers.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **python-telegram-bot**:
    - A Python library that allows the bot to interact with Telegram users, handling messaging and commands.
2. **FastAPI Server**:
    - The backend server that the bot communicates with to fetch and submit questions and answers. (Hosted in a separate repository)

### General Architecture
- **Telegram Bot**: Interacts with users, sending and receiving messages through the `python-telegram-bot` library.
- **FastAPI Server**: Handles requests from the Telegram bot, processes them, and returns appropriate responses (detailed in the separate server repository).

## Workflow

1. **User Interaction**:
    - Users interact with the Telegram bot by sending messages and commands.
2. **API Requests**:
    - The Telegram bot sends API requests to the FastAPI server to fetch questions and submit answers.(including the correct/wrong answer but hidden)
3. **Response**:
    - The FastAPI server processes these requests and sends appropriate responses back to the Telegram bot, which then communicates these responses to the user.
